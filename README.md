## Getting Started

To get started with dbREST, you can visit the [Releases](https://github.com/roshith0896/dbREST/releases) section. Here, you can find the latest version available for download. Once you download the appropriate file, execute it to set up your API.

## Installation

1. **Download the latest release** from the [Releases](https://github.com/roshith0896/dbREST/releases) section.
2. **Extract the files** to your desired location.
3. **Install dependencies**. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure your database settings** in the `config.json` file.

## Usage

After installation, you can start the dbREST server using the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will launch the server on the default port, allowing you to interact with your database through the REST API.

## API Endpoints

dbREST exposes several endpoints to interact with your database. Here are some of the key endpoints:

- **GET /api/data**: Fetch data from the database.
- **POST /api/data**: Insert new data into the database.
- **PUT /api/data/:id**: Update existing data by ID.
- **DELETE /api/data/:id**: Remove data by ID.

## Examples

### Fetching Data

To fetch data from your database, you can use the following curl command:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/data
```

### Inserting Data

To insert new data, you can use:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/data -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Sample", "value": "123"}'
```

### Updating Data

To update data, you can use:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/data/1 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "Updated Sample", "value": "456"}'
```

### Deleting Data
